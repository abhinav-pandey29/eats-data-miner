# Eats Data Miner

_A Gmail-to-Google Sheets automation for food delivery expense tracking._

If youâ€™ve ever found yourself overspending on food delivery apps like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Menulog, youâ€™re not alone. Wouldn't it be nice if you could easily track those expenses?

Thatâ€™s why I created **Eats Data Miner** - an automated way to extract and organize your DoorDash order receipts into clean spreadsheets to simplify tracking your food delivery habits and spending.

Built with **Python**, **Gmail API**, **Google Sheets API**, and **Looker Studio**, Eats Data Miner:

- Fetches DoorDash order confirmation emails from your Gmail Inbox,
- Extracts restaurants, items, costs, and delivery addresses using a custom-built scraper,
- Structures the data into clean, organized Google Sheets tables,
- Connects the data to a Looker Studio dashboard for insights into your spending patterns.

## Hereâ€™s how it works:

Eats Data Miner follows a simple six-step process:

1. **Connect to Gmail** â€“ Authenticate and fetch order confirmation emails.
2. **Extract** â€“ Parse vendor, item, pricing, fees, and delivery details.
3. **Transform** â€“ Flatten and organize extracted data into clean tables.
4. **Validate** â€“ Apply rule checks to catch parsing errors early.
5. **Load** â€“ Save results to local CSV files and a connected Google Sheets workbook (`Orders` and `OrderItems` tables).
6. **Visualize** â€“ Connect to a Looker Studio dashboard for instant insights.

## Setup Instructions

## Running the Script

Once your credentials are set up, running Eats Data Miner is simple:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:

- Authenticate your Gmail account,
- Fetch and parse your DoorDash order confirmation emails,
- Validate and clean the extracted data,
- Save results to `orders.csv` and `order_items.csv`,
- Update your connected Google Sheet,
- Refresh your Looker Studio dashboard with the latest data.

## Sample Output

Once the script finishes running, you'll get two structured datasets:
